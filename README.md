I. Nature of the Seminar
This course is intended to give the student an appreciation of the contributions and limitations of public and non-profit program evaluation, as well as a familiarity with the basic skills needed to conduct evaluations.  Emphasis will be given to coping with the conceptual, methodological, organizational, political, and ethical problems which face evaluators.  The various tasks facing evaluators will be discussed, from developing the questions to presenting the data.  The specific issues addressed in class sessions are noted on the attached class schedule.

II. Logistics and Requirements
1.  Readings.  Except for Cathy O’Neil’s book (Weapons of Math Destruction, Crown 2016), all materials will be distributed via the course’s web page at no cost.  (You can buy Jake VanderPlas’s Python Data Science Handbook if you like, but it is also available free online.)  Assigned readings will be posted via the course page on a weekly basis—no later than the week before the session in which they will be discussed. 

2. Class Discussion.  Each week we will begin wtih a discussion of the readings that address one concern at the intersection of data science and public policy.  

3. Problem Sets.  Students will also be assigned problem sets each week.  Sometimes the problems will be general (create three graphs revealing interesting information about data set you are using, e.g.), other times they will be specific (calculate the average number of 911 calls per day during 2016, e.g.). 

4. Final Report. Your final assignment—one you should be thinking about for the entire semester—will be to use the skills you use to analyze data, write a report, and present your findings to members of the Lab @ DC.   

3.  Grades. Grades will be based on the papers and on contributions to in-class discussion (but not discussion on the course site). 
III. Provisional Schedule
The seminar readings and sessions will be divided into four primary groups: (1) the history of modern crime policy; (2) child development; (3) regulating and (de)criminalizing intoxicants; and (4) policing. Each group will be divided into topics, which are expected to span one or more sessions. This plan for the coverage and pace is subject to revision to accommodate the impact that discussion has on our insights and curiosity. 

Each week will focus on a different topic, with the last three weeks devoted to paper presentations.  The readings will focus on the following topics: 

Finding and obtaining data
Viz, exploration, cleaning, etc.
Geo-spatial analytics
The traditional way: basic regression
The modern way: Train, test & validate
Automation: sci-kit learn (including performance metrics)
Cross-validation
Model Choice -- decision trees, ensemble models 
Hyperparameter tuning
Time series 
Project work day
Project presentations (at The Lab @ DC, if possible)


APPLIED PROJECT

Student groups (of no more than 2 students) will report on the results of a data science project.  A one-page scope of work must be completed by class number 8, with final report ready for presentation in the last class period.  Presentations based on the reports should be no longer than 10 minutes. Model pre-analysis plans and reports will be available. 

The Scope of Work should include:  
a concise description of the policy need for the analysis;
a description of the data and methods to be employed by the students undertaking the analysis; 
identification of specific tasks to be accomplished;
a time line depicting deadlines for the tasks identified in #3.
The final written product will be submitted to the instructors for suggestions no later than end of term.       

Required Elements of the Report for the Applied Project

The suggested contents and order of presentation for the report are as follows:

Executive Summary:  Guidance and examples will be provided in class on formatting the Executive Summary.

Introduction and Background: An introduction to the project, including the names of the team and how/why they became involved, should be given along with a description of the scoping activities, including a brief description of the program, and a synthesis of relevant past research and evaluation findings. Also, cite relevant literature on the program. Here also include an introduction to the rest of the report, as well.

Evaluation Questions: The issues that have been identified and the specific                      questions that were addressed, or should be addressed if the project is an                            evaluation plan, should be provided.

Data Collection: The sources of data available, measures used to address the research questions, data collection methods, and sampling procedures should be discussed. Also, there should be a list of limitations to each type of validity and reliability, as well as actions undertaken to reduce the impact of the limitations identified. Use of a design matrix to cover all of these issues is strongly recommended and required if an evaluation plan only is provided.

Data Analysis: Appropriate tables and figures should be constructed in accordance with guidance given in class for projects that are completed. If the project is an evaluation plan, proposed analytic strategies should be discussed.

Proposed Presentation and Utilization Plan (for Evaluation Plans):  Strategies for presenting the results to key stakeholders and decision-makers and strategies for facilitating utilization should be provided,

Potential Problems and Fall-back Strategies (for Evaluation Plans): Identify the potential problems that may arise in conducting the evaluation and the strategies that should be used to either avoid the problem or deal with its occurrence. 

Conclusion: A brief conclusion should be provided.
